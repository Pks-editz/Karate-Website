        <h1>WHY TO LEARN KARATE ART </h1><br>
        <p1>In the United States, martial arts are more popular than ever. In fact, did you know
          that it's a 4 billion dollar industry? <br><br>If you're considering martial arts either for yourself or your child, it's a great choice!
          There are so many benefits to both <br>your physical and mental health. But it can
          be tough to commit to something new.
          <br><br>That's why we put together this guide with 10 reasons you should learn martial arts. Check it out below.</p1>

         <h2>1. INCREASED CONFIDENCE</h2><br>
         <p2>Increased confidence is something that martial artists of all ages enjoy.
           Whether it's for you or your child, martial arts can<br>help you improve your confidence.<br><br>Practicing, improving, and succeeding at a skill improves
           self-image and gives participants confidence that they can succeed in other areas and ventures.<br><br>In fact children who participate
           in karate or a similar martial art show improved confidence and even better performance in school. <br>So, if you're 
           looking to improve your child's self-confidence or yours, martial arts are a great activity to do so.</p2>
         <h3>2. FULL BODY WORKOUT</h3><BR>
         <p3>Are you looking for a new form of exercise? Martial arts is your answer.<br><br>

          That's because martial arts truly provide a full body workout. The consistent practice has shown to increase overall mobility, <br>improve your body's pressure response, and increase muscle.<br> <br>
          
          Because so many martial arts involve repeat muscular actions over time you'll build strength and burn fat. Who doesn't want that?</p3><br>
         <h4>3. INCREASED FLEXIBILITY</h4><br>
         <p4>Repetitive movements like high kicks, low stances, fancy footwork, and ground maneuvering improve flexibility and mobility which will benefit your overall health.<br><br>

          Did you know that flexibility has many health benefits? Some of them include:<br><br>
          
          Improved posture<br><br>
          
          Better freedom of movement<br><br>
          
          Reduced muscle soreness and tension<br><br>
          
          Improved relaxation of mind and body<br><br>
          
          Reduced risk of injury</p4>
          <H5>4. SELF DEFENSE SKILLS</H5><BR>
          <P>One obvious benefit to learning martial arts is an improved ability to perform self-defense maneuvers in situations where there is a real threat.<BR><BR>

            According to recent data, an aggravated assault occurs every 43 seconds in the United States. Martial arts can prepare practitioners to defend themselves in life-threatening and dangerous situations.<BR><BR>
            
            This is great for you but also really great for your children as well.</P>
